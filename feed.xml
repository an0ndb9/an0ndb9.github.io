Bringing back you folks to the days when I was just a weak, shy and a very less confident guy. I had just completed my schooling and was about to enter in my college phase. I decided to leave my hometown for obvious reasons and took admission in a well known city of Maharashtra &amp;amp; one of the best IT hub‚Äôs in India a.k.a. pune !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background$~&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My whole education was done in boy‚Äôs school. I was average but consistent throughout my schooling &amp;amp; very silent kid from the beginning. As it was only boy‚Äôs school you can figure out my comfort level and interaction around girls ! The point of sharing this is, the whole college thing was new for me &amp;amp; all the students (girls and boys) learning all together was a really big deal for me as I was not taught to roam around in such situations from my childhood.Also, this was my first time living by myself in the hostel away from my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Initial days were too tough, I felt very low at times in those days as I had no friends back then to hangout or to share how I feel about this whole new environment and the reason being, I used to take time to make new friends bcz it gives me a hard time to maintain communication with someone for longer duration to be specific not even more than 5 minutes !! But as time passed, I made some good buddies and had a great company with them (still do !).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;happy-journey-begins&quot;&gt;Happy Journey Begins$~&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was good at gaming especially in the legendary game Counter Strike 1.6 &amp;amp; actually it was the reason that moved me further to initiate the conversation between people who later became my buddies for life ‚ù§Ô∏è. First year completed roughly and I was about to enter into second year. From this day on I enjoyed my diploma day‚Äôs a lot, we used to bunk lectures to play CS at cyber cafe‚Äôs and it was the best time truly. We even installed CS in our lab machines and used to play during our practicals (Once I was caught playing CS during practicals but that‚Äôs another story!). Those were the best days of my life I must say !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As time passed, we were about to complete our three year long journey of diploma. I remember it was the last day of the college and for the first time I got emotional, knowing the fact that I may not be able to hang around with my buddies again but somehow controlled my emotions and said final goodbye to the college, friends and my best place the HOSTEL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout my 3 year journey, I made a significant improvement in my social life by making friends and came out a bit of a so called introverted zone. But still there was a lot of old remnants that I needed to improve upon and get used to the new one for my own personal benefit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;engineering-phase&quot;&gt;Engineering Phase$~&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days passed and finally it was the time to get into the engineering life. I remember that time people used to make a lot of fuss about engineering and they still do ! I don‚Äôt know why but it was surely a no big deal for me. So, I took a admission in this college named VIIT which is located in pune city but doesn‚Äôt feel that way üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was a lateral entry in second year directly so it was pretty weird environment for first initial months bcz people already made their groups, they were used to college, the professors and overall environment. Along with me rhere were 10-15 students just like me who got lateral entry so we made a group of ourselves and used to share stuff going around with each other. Met some wonderful people over here (diverse people I must say) but something was missing from what I had imagined my life will be in the engineering phase. Maybe there were so many studious people out there who used to compete with each other and a very less people who were actually trying to enjoy their life there along with the studies ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
People always say I‚Äôm a too serious or so called studious guy by looking at my appearance and some people even say I‚Äôm kind of rude having gallon of attitude filled inside me but I haven‚Äôt understood how they judge on the basis of appearance. I admit that I may not talk with everyone or may be no talking at all :P but it is just my behavior that way. I prefer quality over quantity and I make small number of connections with likely minded people. At the end of day, it‚Äôs not the game of good or bad but it‚Äôs the game of vibes !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So, during that year of college I was living a very lonely life like my daily routine was to go to the college &amp;amp; come back to my PG room. I hardly used to go out my room as there was noone to hangout with and all my old friends were into different colleges. During such lonely times, I used to remember negative memories of my good old diploma day‚Äôs not intensionally though. Talking about one such memory, I remember one day after college my mood was very low so I came in my room and stood there staring at the mirror and out of nowhere I started crying. Straight away some old memories started flashing &amp;amp; I remembered there was this person during those day‚Äôs who said, ‚ÄúAnyway, you just look like a dog‚Äù though it was in a casual way and was not a big deal at all but that hit me so harder that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was this ugly looking, less confident and very malnourished kid during those days and that added further salt on my open wounds. While staring at the mirror, I started cussing myself for the kind of guy I was. At that very moment I decided something needs to be done to enrich my physical appearance &amp;amp; the first thought in my head was to hit the gym !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/journey/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;towards-brighter-light&quot;&gt;Towards Brighter Light$~&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next day itself I went to enquire about gyms in my area and found one of the best gyms out there. I remember at the counter there was this lady whom I enquired about the fees for annual gym membership and she said to me if I have seen the gym floor, if not then she wanted to give me the tour. In no time I said, I have seen photos online so just take the money and let me know when can I come to lift some iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During this one year membership I significantly gain some weight/muscles and transformed into good shape, muscles were popping out, tshirts were fitting well and this gave me a hell lot of confidence. From the day when no one used to approach me to talk first to the day when people came to compliment my appearance and asked for gym tips, I have seen my journey ‚ù§Ô∏è.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I started following UFC a lot those days, I felt the insane adrenaline rush in my body and also started liking boxing &amp;amp; stuff. All these things helped me to overwrite my past self image and I finally began to believe in myself !! Well I‚Äôm truly thankful to that person, really grateful for your lightening words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, the college life was moving so fast and was about to conclude in small duration of time. I had lot of plans for my last year but as we all know the covid came into existence and ruined evey plan of ourselves. Half of my engineering got carried out while attending those online lectures on zoom sitting at home in comfort. Never imagined this would be concluded in such a way and may be that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt hold any special memories of my engineering phase. It was not even close to feeling sad when I was about to give my last project presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately everything went well in my academic journey and finally it came to happy ending with minimal regrets !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qwik-peek&quot;&gt;qwik-Peek$~&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I made this much progress &amp;amp; still going on like a mad man everyday. I admire master Saitama a lot (a fictional character from my favourite anime - One Punch Man) &amp;amp; my dream is to be like him !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Let‚Äôs get started with the actual PoC !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-information&quot;&gt;Product Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Vendor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Seceon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Inc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Seceon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;aiSIEM&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;6.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;585&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Vulnerability&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Unauthenticated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Takeover&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Severity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CRITICAL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poc--proof-of-concept&quot;&gt;PoC | Proof of Concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1. Go to login page of Seceon aiSIEM and click on ‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù button. URL - https://192.168.x.x/nextgen/v1/#/login/forgot-password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/seceon/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2. Configure any browser with burp suite localhost IP &amp;amp; port to intercept requests/responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3. Open burp suite proxy interceptor, go to ‚ÄúProxy‚Äù tab and ensure Intercept is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4. Now, enter the email address of the victim and click on ‚ÄúSend Reset Link‚Äù button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5. You will observe the following request in burp suite, click on forward to proceed with the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/seceon/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6. Observe the next request very carefully, here the GET request call is being made to ‚Äúsendemail‚Äù API endpoint along with the password reset (token) link !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/seceon/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#7. Paste the copied link into the browser and enter the new password for the victim‚Äôs SIEM account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/seceon/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#8. Password is successfully changed and now an attacker can login with a victim‚Äôs email address &amp;amp; new password that has been just changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/seceon/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any malicious user/attacker can change the credentials of any user/victim with only email address of victim‚Äôs account and that results in complete account takeover of the user. Only prerequisite to successful account takeover is email address of the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheers-&quot;&gt;Cheers !&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability got fixed in newer build versions &amp;amp; can not be exploitable further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MITRE CVE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28293&quot;&gt;Check Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So here‚Äôs the writeup for round 2 &amp;amp; 3 of TCS HackQuest Season 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 2 was group discussion among 10 participants in each group. It was all about the approach taken to solve the CTF challegnes of round 1. Learnt lot from my fellow participants while we were discussing about every approach possible to solve the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 3 was proctored CTF round where we had to turn on the camera throughout the challenge duration. There were 3 CTF challenges &amp;amp; time duration was 2 hours. I managed to solve 2 and got 600 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After solving the CTF challenges we were given 1 hour to document everything we did to obtain the flag in a word document provided by TCS HackQuest team. So, make sure to write understandable descriptive steps that you have taken to solve the challenges &amp;amp; take screenshots of everything you do !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this blog in a very beginner friendly way to help my future infosec buddies !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are the 2 challenges that I managed to solve in Round 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-its-exposed-&quot;&gt;1. It‚Äôs Exposed !!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hq5{50m3*pu811c}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This challenge was simple OSINT. As it was given in the challenge about company startup named ‚Äì arcanehqdev. So, I ran simple google search with this keyword &amp;amp; got following results. 
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/osint1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then click on search instead &amp;amp; it gives 2 URLs which are related to Trello boards. Clicking on first Trello board link gives:
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/osint2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As we can see there‚Äôs a pastebin link shared with description as: Saved key. So, I browsed the link &amp;amp; got the key.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/osint3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submitting this key into the challenge website link returns the flag.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/osint4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-a-pandemic-inhibitor&quot;&gt;2. A Pandemic Inhibitor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hq5{y0u_54v3d_y0u2531f}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are given a website link, when we visit this link we see all sorts of guidelines and basic static info on the page regarding covid-19. Viewing the source code of the page, reveals a interesting API endpoint.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/api1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we visit this endpoint, we get the following API information that may present on the website along with the required parameters for each API call.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/api2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now I tried all the API requests with trial &amp;amp; error methdology and observed the responses in burp suite. The one which gave me the flag was API: &lt;em&gt;assistpersonnel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then I capture the request in burp suite, added all the required parameters ‚Äì helpingid, amount &amp;amp; comment. When I sent this request, the response came in as Helping ID is not registered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then I thought of inputting my DT ID which is used to login in the TCS portal inside the parameter helpingid and guess what I got the flag in response of api request.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/api3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gracias &amp;amp; all the best&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-heart&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; !!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tcs" /><category term="ctf" /><category term="tcshackquest" /><category term="hackquest5" /><category term="contest-based-hiring" /><category term="grandfinalist" /><category term="top10" /><category term="ethicalhacking" /><summary type="html">Hello again !

&lt;p&gt;It was quite amazing journey to be honest to compete with 22 thousand participants from 600+ instituions all across India ! I was one of the top 10 grand finalist of TCS HackQuest Season 5, awarded with 10k INR cash prize &amp;amp; job offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there were 3 rounds this season which were consisting of CTF challenges, Group Discussion &amp;amp; proctored CTF round (which was the final round.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 1 had time duration of 4 hours in which we were given 10 challenges of different categories (such as Web, Reversing, Forensics, etc..) After solving the round 1 challenges we were given 2 hours to document everything we did to obtain the flag in a word document provided by TCS HackQuest team. So, make sure to write understandable descriptive steps that you have taken to solve the challenges &amp;amp; take screenshots of everything you do !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this blog in a very beginner friendly way to help my future infosec buddies !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are the 5 challenges that I managed to solve in Round - 1 and got 900 points!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-digi-magic&quot;&gt;1. Digi Magic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hq5{s0_Y0u_KN0W_HoW_$$1_worKs}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the challenge talked about digital signature, it instantly came to my mind to check for SSL/TLS certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I clicked on ‚ÄòView Certificate‚Äô option in mozilla firefox browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There in the Locality field, you will see the base64 encoded string just decode it and you will get the flag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-i-am-always&quot;&gt;2. I Am Always&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hq5{w1nn324v3n932}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the challenge talked about hidden flag and when I browse through the challenge link, there  were  multiple images and first thought in my mind was to check for steganography or some sort of EXIF embedding in image metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I downloaded all the images from the challenge link.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools Used: 	&lt;a href=&quot;http://metapicz.com/#landing&quot;&gt;Metapicz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I search in all images for EXIF manipulation &amp;amp; found cool endpoint string in metadata of Hulk image.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/IAmAlways1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit this endpoint and you will get the flag !!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/IAmAlways2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-ice-cream-dispenser&quot;&gt;3. Ice Cream Dispenser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hq5{110v3*1c3_c234m}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This challenge involved small guess work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I intercepted the request in burp suite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Request: GET /geticecream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I send this request, response came in as ‚Äì ‚ÄúMissing Flavour‚Äù. So, I added flavour parameter with a random string.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For example: GET /geticecream?flavour=mango. But then again response returned as ‚Äì ‚ÄúAre you requesting it correctly!‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then I change the GET request to POST and guess what the flag was returned in the response.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final request: POST /geticecream?flavour=mango

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hq5{3nc2yp7*m45732}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This challenge was simple code review and bypassing of weak pattern matching function.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Viewing the source code of the challenge page gives us commented source code at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; Code:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;replace_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$j0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$a1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$j0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;##hackquestchamp&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;preg_replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/hackquestchamp/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$j0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#replacing with empty string&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$a1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;str_contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'hackquestchamp'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Finally Working &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;replace_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As you can see it will match the string &lt;em&gt;hackquestchamp&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; replace it with the empty string.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So,to bypass this weak pattern matching, simply input the following string.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final String: &lt;em&gt;hackquesthackquestchampchamp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pattern matching will remove the middle string &lt;em&gt;‚Äòhackquestchamp‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; completely &amp;amp; then first &lt;em&gt;‚Äòhackquest‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; string gets joined with last &lt;em&gt;‚Äòchamp‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; string resulting in function bypass and it returns our flag.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/ReggieRich-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-record&quot;&gt;5. Record&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;HQ5{Malware_implement_persistence}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This challenge was too time consuming to check through all the logs to identify the flag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After clicking on ‚ÄúTake Me To Binary‚Äù, a RAR file get downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decompressing it will give two files: App.evtx &amp;amp; system.evtx&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firstly, I checked what is the file type by running Unix command - file.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/Record-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As you can see in the screenshot, it is the event log file which can be opened by Windows Event Viewer. I immediately open both files and started looking for any intresting logs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the challenge specifically said about ‚Äúmalware‚Äù. So, I tried searching record with string such as Trojan, Malware, Ransomware &amp;amp; to my notice I found one ransomware record consisting of based64 encoded string in the system.evtx log file.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/public/media/Record-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decode the string and you will get the flag in plain text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
